# Note about Data Acquisition
Because of the large nature of the data used to make the data models, I cannot upload the CSV I used to github. Instead, I will include a link to the .gov site where it came from, if you want to run these scripts on 
your own R environment. The link is below:
https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/

To view this report in full, please run the included script file using the "institution-level data" included in the above website, and name it according to the expected filename. The resultant models should reflect the
conclusions indicated by the report. The report itself is sourced in IEEE format, and was written for the IUPUI School of Science Capstone program, CSCI49500.
